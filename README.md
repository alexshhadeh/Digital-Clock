# Digital Clock

A digital clock displaying current time and date. Written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Features:
- Switch between a 12 and 24-hour clock
- Change time; you can add or substract hours, minutes and seconds.
- Every time you change the time, it is saved in sessionStorage, and thus, when you decide to return to the page, it will display it correctly.
- You can also set the time by using setTime() function; the function takes miliseconds as an input, and adds them to January 1, 1970. There's an example line in the code that you can uncomment to set the date to ```Thu Mar 22 2012 09:11:22 GMT+0100 (Central European Standard Time)``` by adding 1332403882588 milliseconds to January 1, 1970.
- A pleasing to the eye design :)

## Running the clock:
1. Clone this repository: ```git clone <link_to_the_repository>```.
2. Open ```index.html``` file.
