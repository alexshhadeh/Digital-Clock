# Digital Clock

A digital clock displaying current time and date. Written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Features:
- Switch between a 12 and 24-hour clock
- Change time; you can add or substract hours, minutes and seconds.
- Every time you change the time, it is saved in sessionStorage, and thus, when you decide to return to the page, it will display it correctly.
- A pleasing to the eye design :)

## Running the clock:
1. Clone this repository: ```git clone <link_to_the_repository>```.
2. Open ```index.html``` file.
